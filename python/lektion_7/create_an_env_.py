"""
These are the steps to starting a virtual env in your current project.

Always recommended to have virtual env to keep machine clean and the third party extenstions working  well. 

These are commands to run in the terminal 

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install <package-name> # install packages 

deactivate # deactivates the virtual environment 

rm -rf venv # delete the venv *****watch out! I did this once and accidently deleted my entire local school folder **


**Make sure after creation that you change your interpreter to the one that has Python 3.11.1('venv:venv)**
